// It seems that VS Code relies on `Typescript` for the code reference
// discoveries. This works well for non-monorepo projects, since there's
// a single `tsconfig.json` file in the root of the project, that
// points to (the `include` option) all other project files. Monorepos usually
// define a more clear separation of which files can be seen by which project
// (a tsconfig.json file per library/project). Issue discussion and the recipe
// for this workaround: https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/3106#issuecomment-1328403076.
// Tip: You can find changed options by searching for:
// `// Enables finding symbol references in VS Code.`
